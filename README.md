The application enables the entry of data on material damages that occurred on the insured vehicle. 
The application keeps records of insured persons, their vehicles and material damages that occurred on those vehicles.
For each insured, the system enabled the creation, updating of each insureds from the records.

Entering data about the vehicle can be done after entering data about the insured if the insured does not exist in the system.
